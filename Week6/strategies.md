## Rendering Strategies

## SSR
Server-Side Rendering, allows your pages to be rendered on the server before sending them to the client. This
  can improve performance and SEO.
- In SSR, the server generates the HTML for a page and sends it to the client. This is common in frameworks like
  Next.js or more traditional approaches like PHP. For instance, a blog platform built with WordPress where the server processes the request, fetches
  the necessary data from database, and renders the complete HTML on the server before sending it to the client.
- **Pros:**
    - Improved initial loading time as pages are pre-rendered on the server.
    - Better SEO, as search engines can easily crawl and index content.
- **Cons:**
    - Higher server load, as rendering happens on the server for each request.
    - Slower subsequent page navigation due to server round-trips.

### SSG
Static Site Generation, where pages are pre-rendered at build time, resulting in faster loading for static
  content.
- Example Stack: Gatsby.js with React and Contentful (or other headless CMS)
- SSG pre-builds pages at build time, resulting in static HTML files. An example is an e-commerce site where product pages are generated during the build process. Gatsby fetches product data from a headless CMS like Contentful and creates HTML files for each product, making them load quickly for users.
- **Pros:**
    - Extremely fast initial loading, as pages are pre-built at build time.
    - Cost-effective for serving static content to a large audience.
- **Cons:**
    - Limited dynamic content, as updates require a rebuild.
    - Increased build complexity for dynamic data.
### ISR
Incremental Static Regeneration, allows you to update static pages without rebuilding the entire site.
- Example Stack: Next.js with React and Vercel
- ISR combines the benefits of SSR and SSG. It allows for pre-rendering but can update specific pages without a full rebuild. Imagine a news website where most content is static, but the latest news section is updated frequently. ISR can regenerate only the latest news section while keeping the rest of the site static.
- **Pros:**
    - Extremely fast initial loading, as pages are pre-built at build time.
    - Cost-effective for serving static content to a large audience.
- **Cons:**
    - Limited dynamic content, as updates require a rebuild.
    - Increased build complexity for dynamic data.
### CSR
Client-Side Rendering, allows you to fetch data on the client-side and render pages dynamically.
- Example Stack: React with Rest API or GraphQL
- CSR loads a minimal HTML page on the client, and the content is rendered using JavaScript. For instance, a single-page application (SPA) where the client receives a basic HTML structure, and then JavaScript fetches data from a server (via an API) and dynamically updates the page without full page reloads.
- *Pros:*
    - Fast subsequent page navigation, as rendering happens on the client.
    - Flexibility to fetch and update data dynamically.
- *Cons:*
    - Slower initial page loading, as rendering occurs after data fetching.
    - SEO challenges, as search engines may have difficulty indexing client-rendered content.

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is about making websites easy for search engines like Google to understand. The main
goal is to help a website show up higher in search results when people look for things online. This involves using the
right words (keywords) in titles and descriptions, organizing the website in a way that makes sense, and getting other
websites to link to it.

When you search for something on Google, the results you see are not random. Google uses a special formula to decide
which websites are the most relevant and helpful for what you searched. SEO is like giving your website a good makeover
so that it fits well with this formula. It's not just about using the right words but also making sure your website is
user-friendly and liked by other websites. The better your website matches what people are searching for, the higher it
might appear in the search results.
