# Component Libraries, Forms and Login

## Component Libraries

React Native component libraries are collections of pre-built, reusable components that you can use to build your mobile applications more efficiently. These libraries offer a wide range of UI components such as buttons, forms, navigation elements, and much more, which adhere to specific design systems or are customizable to fit your app's design requirements. Utilizing these libraries can significantly speed up the development process, ensure consistency across the app, and improve the overall user experience with polished and tested components.

Some popular React Native Component Libraries in no particular order are:

- [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/): This is one of the most popular and versatile component libraries in the React Native ecosystem. It provides a variety of components that are easy to use and customize, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
- [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/): NativeBase offers a comprehensive set of components that allow developers to build responsive apps with a native look and feel. It supports both iOS and Android platforms and provides a seamless way to include cross-platform components in your app.
- [UI Kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/): UI Kitten is a React Native UI library that follows the Eva Design System. It's particularly useful for developers looking to implement a consistent design language across their app with minimal effort. It also offers theming capabilities that make it easy to customize the appearance of components.
- [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/): Inspired by Google's Material Design, React Native Paper provides a wide range of components that adhere to Material Design guidelines. It's a great choice if you're looking to incorporate Material Design elements into your React Native app.
- [Shoutem UI](https://new.shoutem.com/): Shoutem UI is a set of styleable components that follow a clear design pattern, making it easy to build beautiful and functional React Native apps. The library is part of the Shoutem UI toolkit, which also includes themes and a customizable architecture.
- [React Native UI Lib](https://wix.github.io/react-native-ui-lib/): This library, developed by Wix, offers a wide range of UI components and helpers designed to build high-quality user interfaces. It emphasizes performance and customizability.
- And [many more](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-native-component-libraries/)...

Benefits of Using Component Libraries:

- **Efficiency:** Component libraries save time by providing ready-to-use, customizable components that you can integrate into your app without building them from scratch.
- **Consistency:** Using components from the same library throughout your app helps maintain visual and functional consistency.
- **Quality and Reliability:** Well-maintained libraries offer components that have been tested and optimized for performance and compatibility across devices.
- **Customization:** Many libraries provide a high degree of customization, allowing you to adjust the components to fit your app's branding and design requirements.

When selecting a component library for your React Native project, consider factors such as the library's design system, the range and flexibility of components, community support, and how actively the library is maintained. It's also helpful to review the documentation and examples to ensure that the library meets your project's needs and that you'll be comfortable working with it.

## Lab assignment 1: Convert the app we've made so far to use React Native Elements

We use React Native Elements in this lab assignment example. You are free to choose any other library in your individual project assignment.

1. Continue last exercise. Create a new branch 'comp-lib' with git.
1. Install [SafeAreaContext](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/safe-area-context/): `npm install react-native-safe-area-context`
   - This is a dependency for React Native Elements and replaces the `SafeAreaView` component
   - Wrap the whole app with `<SafeAreaProvider>` in `App.tsx`
1. Install React Native Elements to your project `npm install @rneui/base @rneui/themed`.
1. Modify your components to use appropriate components from React Native Elements.
   - import the [components](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs) from `@rneui/themed` and use them in your components
   - remove all stylesheets, styles and unnecessary imports
   - Some components you may find useful for the task: `Button`, `Card`, `Divider`, `Content`, `Header`, `Icon`, `Text`...
   - For media listing you can use [`ListItem` component](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/components/listitem)
   - By default [Icon component](https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/components/icon) uses [Material icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) as value for type attribute
1. For adding icons to bottom tabs refer this [example](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/material-bottom-tab-navigator/#example)

## Lab assignment 2: Implementing login and registration functionality with React Hook Form

1. Continue last exercise. Create a new branch 'login' with git.
1. Study:
    - [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#ReactNative)
    - [React Native Forms using React-Hook-Form](https://www.akashmittal.com/react-native-forms-using-react-hook-form/)
1. Install React Hook Form `npm i react-hook-form`
1. Copy `contexts/UserContext.tsx` and `hooks/ContextHooks.ts` from the 'plain' React app to your React Native app
    - Remove all navigation related code not used with React Native: `useNavigate`, `useLocation` and function calls that use them
    - Replace all `localStorage` usage with [`AsyncStorage`](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/install/)
1. Wrap the `Navigator` with `UserProvider` in `App.tsx`
1. Create components `LoginForm.tsx` and `RegisterForm.tsx` to `components` folder and copy `views/Login.tsx` from the 'plain' React app to your React Native app
1. Add `Login` view to stack navigator in `Navigator.tsx` and display it instead of other navigation components if user is not logged in
   - check from `UserContext` if user is not null
   - after this you should be able to see the login view only
1. Implement `LoginForm` using React Hook Form:

    ```tsx
    const LoginForm = () => {
      const {handleLogin} = useUserContext();
      const initValues: Credentials = {username: '', password: ''};
      const {
        control,
        handleSubmit,
        formState: {errors},
      } = useForm({
        defaultValues: initValues,
      });

      const doLogin = async (inputs: Credentials) => {
        handleLogin(inputs);
      };

      return (
        <Card>
          <Controller
            control={control}
            rules={{
              required: {value: true, message: 'is required'},
            }}
            render={({field: {onChange, onBlur, value}}) => (
              <Input
                placeholder="Username"
                onBlur={onBlur}
                onChangeText={onChange}
                value={value}
                autoCapitalize="none"
                errorMessage={errors.username?.message}
              />
            )}
            name="username"
          />

          <Controller
            control={control}
            rules={{
              maxLength: 100,
              required: {value: true, message: 'is required'},
            }}
            render={({field: {onChange, onBlur, value}}) => (
              <Input
                placeholder="password"
                secureTextEntry
                onBlur={onBlur}
                onChangeText={onChange}
                value={value}
                errorMessage={errors.password?.message}
              />
            )}
            name="password"
          />
          <Button title="Login" onPress={handleSubmit(doLogin)} />
        </Card>
      );
    };
    ```

1. Add logout functionality to `Profile` view and `UserContext`:
    - Add a button to `Profile` view for logging out
    - Use `handleLogout` provided by `UserContext` and use it with the button
    - Use `AsyncStorage` to remove the token from the device
    - After the user state is updated in context, Navigator automatically displays the Login view
1. Implement `RegisterForm` similar to `LoginForm` but with additional fields for `email` and  password confirmation (`confirmPassword`)
    - Get api functions from `useUser` hook: `const {postUser, getUsernameAvailable, getEmailAvailable} = useUser();`
    - Username availability should be checked when the input field loses focus, implement your own validation function for this:

      ```ts
      rules={{
        // other rules here
        ...
        validate: async (value) => {
          try {
            const {available} = await getUsernameAvailable(value);
            console.log('username available?', value, available);
            return available ? available : 'Username taken';
          } catch (error) {
            console.log((error as Error).message);
          }
        },
      }}
      ```

    - Add proper validation rules for password
      - at least minimum length, but you might use more complex rules using a regex pattern, example:

        ```ts
        ...
        rules={{
          pattern: {
            // simple email regex pattern, do better? 
            value: /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/,
            message: 'not a valid email',
          },
          // other rules
        }}
        ...        
        ```

    - and email as well:
      - check availability
      - use proper regex pattern
    - Confirm password should match the actual password, you can do this by adding _validate_ to _rules_ of `<Controller>` of confirm password field
      - extract [_getValues_](https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/getvalues) from _useForm_ to get the value of password field
      - before sending the form to the API you'll need to delete confirm password property from the data object because API might reject data if it has extra properties.
1. In `Login` Add a link/button for switching between login/register forms ("No account yet?" or something).
1. Implement a token based auto login feature in `Login` component
    - Call `handleAutoLogin` from `UserContext` in `useEffect` **only once** when the component is rendered
1. Try the app on a real device. You can see that it's hard/impossible to write since keyboard is covering the input fields. Use [KeyboardAvoidingView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/keyboardavoidingview) (or ScrollView) in `Login.tsx` to fix the issue.
1. Hiding the keyboard has to be done manually:

   ```tsx
   <TouchableOpacity
        onPress={() => Keyboard.dismiss()}
        style={{flex: 1}}
        activeOpacity={1}
      >
    ...
    ...
   </TouchableOpacity>
   ```

## Lab assignment 3: Implement profile view and adapt the missing features from the 'plain' React app

1. Continue last exercise. Merge it to _main_ branch and create a new development branch _profile_ with git for these tasks.
1. Dislplay all user data in `Profile` view
   - Use `UserContext` to get user data
   - Use `Card` and `ListItem` components from React Native Elements to display user data
   - Extra: Add user profile update functionality to profile page (similar to registration form)
1. Add new view `MyFiles.tsx` and add it to stack navigator
1. Add a button on Profile page which opens MyFiles:
   - Display a list of user's own files, very similar to Home: You can use Home and MediaListItem as example and make new components
1. Refer to the 'plain' React app and add likes, comments, tags and ratings to the `Single` view
   - For ratings, you can use [react-native-star-rating-widget](https://github.com/bviebahn/react-native-star-rating-widget)
   - Implementing upload page with image picker, and other native apis will be covered in the next lab assignments
1. Add and commit changes to git, push to Github.
